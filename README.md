**The Galaxy**
-
The goal of this project is to pilot a spaceship through the galaxy. For this purpose, an automatically generated path is to be followed. 
In the first finished version there should only be a score.

**Version01** 
In the first version, the grid is created in which the path should run. In addition, the grid is made movable to the right and left, so that it looks as if the spaceship follows the path afterwards.
On the computer the arrow keys can be used. On the cell phone you can use touch on the right and left side.

**Version02**
In the second version it is possible to follow the track with the space shuttel. There is no game over yet (only via output on the computer in the terminal).
